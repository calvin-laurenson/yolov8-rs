Experimental Rust wrapper for YOLOv8 ONNX models. Supports static image size models as well as dynamic image size models (dynamic=true). Also supports batched inference in dynamic models.

Thanks to https://github.com/AndreyGermanov/yolov8_onnx_rust for helping me figure out how to decode the output.
